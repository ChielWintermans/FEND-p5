## Neighbourhood Map project
### About

This project required creating a single page application using the Knockout framework. The app is an interactive map of venues in my neighborhood, with a list-view and markers for the locations. The list is acquired from Yelp & Foursquare data and clicking on the marker or list entry brings up an infowindow with relevant information. 
The venues can be filtered by category or searched with a text entry.

### How to run
